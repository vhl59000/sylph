# Agent Workflow - Sylph

This file is the single source of truth for all AI agents working in this repo.
Read it before starting any task. Company and product context lives in `CONTEXT.md`.

> **Cross-tool support**: this file is read natively by Codex CLI and Cursor,
> and imported by Claude Code via `CLAUDE.md`. Skills follow the
> [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard and live in `.claude/skills/`.

## 0. Definitions

The **CAO (Chief Agent Officer)** role is shared between Newsquick's two co-founders:
- **Valentin Henry-Leo** (he/him) — CEO. GTM, product, strategy.
- **Antoine [last name TBC]** — CTO. Intelligence layer, modeling, quant research (ex-Point72 / Cubist Systematic Strategies).

Either CAO can review, approve, and have final say on agent output. When uncertain which CAO owns a domain, default routing: product/strategy/GTM → Valentin; modeling/research/infra → Antoine.

## 1. Orient first

Before doing anything, identify:
- **What domain** does this task belong to? (content, sales, product, brand, finance, etc.)
- **Which channel or subfolder** is relevant? (e.g. `content/linkedin/`, `sales/outbound/`)
- **Is there a skill** for this task? Check the skill index below.

If a skill exists, load and follow it. Skills encode channel-specific rules, tone, format, and workflow steps.

---

## 2. Read before writing

Before generating any content or making decisions:

1. Read the relevant `_insights.md` for the channel/domain - it contains what works, what doesn't, cadence, and audience notes.
2. Read the `_examples/` files for the channel - these are the best-performing pieces and serve as the quality bar.
3. Read any relevant `_templates/` - use them as structural starting points.

If these files are empty, proceed without them but note that examples and insights are missing.

---

## 3. Content lifecycle - always follow this

Every piece of content follows this path:

```
create -> _drafts/ -> review/edit -> _published/ -> update _insights.md -> promote to _examples/ if high-performing
```

| Stage | Folder | When |
|-------|--------|------|
| Working draft | `_drafts/` | While creating or iterating |
| Finalized/published | `_published/` | After it's approved and sent/posted |
| Insights update | `_insights.md` | After publishing - log what worked, what didn't, performance |
| Example | `_examples/` | Only when a piece performs well - used for future generation |

**Always save new content to `_drafts/` first.** Never write directly to `_published/` or `_examples/`.

---

## 4. File naming

```
YYYY-MM-DD_short-slug.md
```

Example: `2026-04-05_linkedin-context-engineering.md`

---

## 5. Frontmatter

All content files must include frontmatter:

```yaml
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
channel: linkedin
topic: context-engineering
format: post
status: draft
performance:
notes:
---
```

---

## 6. Updating memory

After completing a task, if you learned something non-obvious:
- Log decisions and learnings in `.claude/MEMORY.md`
- Update the relevant `_insights.md` if content performance or patterns were observed

---

## 8. Skill index

Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. Each has a `SKILL.md` with `name` and `description` frontmatter.

**How to invoke:**
- **Claude Code**: type `/skill-name` (auto-discovered from `.claude/skills/`)
- **Cursor**: type `/skill-name` (auto-discovered from `SKILL.md` frontmatter)
- **Codex CLI**: use `$skill-name` or ask by name (auto-discovered from `.agents/skills/`)

## 9. Adding new skills

### How to create a skill

1. Create `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
2. Include `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter
3. Add the skill to the index table above

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: One line explaining what the skill does and when to use it.
---

# Skill Title

Instructions here...
```

### How each tool discovers skills

| Tool | Discovery path | Mechanism |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` | Scans this directory at session start |
| Codex CLI | `.agents/skills/` | Symlink to `.claude/skills/` - Codex auto-discovers from here |
| Cursor | `.claude/skills/` | Finds `SKILL.md` files with `name`/`description` frontmatter project-wide |

All three tools also read `AGENTS.md` for workflow instructions and the skill index.

### Why this structure - do not change it

Skills must be flat under `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` (one level).
Claude Code only discovers skills at this depth - adding domain subdirectories
(e.g. `.claude/skills/agents/chief-of-staff/`) breaks discovery.

Codex CLI requires `.agents/skills/` for auto-discovery, so we symlink it to
`.claude/skills/`. This gives both tools the same skills from a single source.

Cursor scans the whole project for `SKILL.md` files. `.cursorignore` excludes
`.agents/skills/` (symlink duplicate) and `.claude/worktrees/` (Claude Code
git worktrees that contain full repo copies) to prevent duplicates.

Do not:
- Add domain subdirectories inside `.claude/skills/` - Claude Code only scans one level deep
- Move skills to `.agents/skills/` - Claude Code would stop finding them
- Remove the `.agents/skills` symlink - Codex would lose auto-discovery
- Remove `.cursorignore` - Cursor would show duplicate slash commands
